What we need to get done this week:
1. Finish disassembling the chassis robot.  Pay attention to what you are taking apart,  Try to learn how it works so you understand how to put it back together.
2. Teach others how to do different tasks on the chassis (tap holes, put wheels together, electrical configuration etc.
3.  Start putting the chassis back together.  (try to make sure someone is learning how to do what you are doing and you are not the only one that knows how.)
4.  Anything else you can think of to better the team.
