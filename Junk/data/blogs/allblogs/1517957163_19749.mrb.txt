We started off week 4 with a minor setback, but in the meantime, we made our Charmain's Award submission online, as well as completed a T-shirt design. We had a delay in completing the chassis, so we rebuilt a previous year's frame to fit the sizing for this year, and it will be used for software to do testing after bag & tag day. We did get the chassis parts in, and it, along with other subassemblies, is close to complete. We also worked on crimping the wires on the circuit board and neared completion on the frame. Overall, the week was a success.
