                <h4>Seeding Matches</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  Competition begins with seeding matches, where every team plays 5-8 head-to-head matches against other teams.
                  At the end, teams are ranked based on the total score across their matches.
                  Their lowest scoring match will be dropped and not counted as part of the total.
                  The top 7 or top 15 ranked teams (depending on the total number of teams) will automatically advance to semifinals.
                </p>

                <h4>Wildcard Match</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  Of the teams that did not automatically advance to semifinals, the 4 or top 8 teams (depending on the total number of teams) 
                  with the highest Engineering Notebook scores will play 1 more head-to-head match against each other.
                  The highest scoring team will advance to the semifinals.

                <p>
                  The teams who made it to this round will play 3 head-to-head matches against the other teams. 
                  The teams will be ranked once again based on the total score across all of their matches.
                  Unlike the seeding round, their lowest scoring match will not be dropped. 
                  The 4 highest ranked teams will advance to finals.

                  In the championship round, the 4 final teams play 3 head-to-head matches against each other.
                  The team with the highest combined score across the 3 matches wins the competition.

                <hr>
                <p>
                  FRC matches are played on an alliance with 2 other teams. 
                  During a match, teams race to not only gain match points and win, 
                  but also ranking points, which are awarded to the entire alliance. 
                  During the qualification round, teams play a series of head-to-head matches 
                  in which they are randomly placed on an alliance. 
                  At the end, teams are ranked based on the average number of ranking points 
                  they have earned across all of their matches.

                <h4>Alliance Selections</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  After the qualification matches, the top 8 teams, called alliance captains, have the opportunity 
                  to create their own permanent alliance for the playoffs. 
                  Going in order from the highest seed to the lowest seed, alliance captains 
                  take turns selecting a team to be on their alliance. 
                  A selected team may not already be on an alliance and 
                  can choose to either accept or decline the invitation. 
                  If the selected team declines, the alliance captain selects another team 
                  and the process repeats until a team accepts. 
                  Once a team has been selected, they cannot be selected again, 
                  regardless of whether they accepted or declined the invite.
                  If a team that is set to be an alliance captain joins another alliance, 
                  the teams ranked below them move up to fill the empty spot. 
                  Once all 8 alliance captains have selected an alliance partner, the 
                  selection process repeats for the second alliance partners, 
                  this time going from the lowest seed to the highest seed. 
                  Once the 8 alliances for playoffs have been established, alliance selections conclude.

                <h4>Playoff Matches</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  After alliance selections, playoff matches begin. 
                  Alliances compete in a single elimination bracket and advance by winning 
                  the best of 3 matches against the opposing alliance. 
                  There are no ranking points in the playoffs. 
                  At the end, we have awards. 
                  The winning alliance captain, winning alliance first pick, and other award winners advance to the championship.
