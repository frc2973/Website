We visited ATF and toured their facilities, seeing where they practice fire rescue and test bomb squad robots. Students were able to speak to members of the industry and get up close and even drive the robots! It was a fantastic experience. The Mad Rockers Team 2973 would like to extend a thank you to ATF for allowing us to visit the facility and learn more about what they do.
