The 2019 Build Season has finally begun! On Saturday, the Mad Rockers visited the U.S. Space and Rocket Center to receive the year's competition information. The game is called DESTINATION: DEEP SPACE. We now have 6 weeks during which we must design, prototype, build, program, and prepare our robot for the Rocket City Regional in March. After the Kickoff event, our team went back to the pit to discuss the year's game and our plan for the next 6 weeks. It is officially go time.
